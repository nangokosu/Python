Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 6. 
A Contracting Party breaches the obligation of fair and equitable treatment referenced in paragraph 2 where a measure or a series of measures constitutes: a) denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings; or b) fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency and obstacles to effective access to justice, in judicial and administrative proceedings; or c) manifest arbitrariness; or d) targeted discrimination on manifestly wrongful grounds, such as gender, race or religious belief; or e) harassment, coercion, abuse of power or similar bad faith conduct. 
When applying the above fair and equitable treatment obligation, a Tribunal may take into account whether a Party made a specific representation to an investor to induce a covered investment, that created a legitimate expectation, and upon which the investor relied in deciding to make or maintain the covered investment, but that the Party subsequently frustrated. 
For greater certainty, ‘full protection and security’ refers to the Contracting Party’s obligations relating to physical security of investors and covered investments. 
For greater certainty, a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of any other international agreement, does not constitute a breach of this Article.
