Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. In addition, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full physical security and protection. 
A Contracting Party breaches the aforementioned obligation of fair and equitable treatment where a measure or series of measures constitutes: a) Denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings; b) Fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial and administrative proceedings; c) Manifest arbitrariness; d) Direct or targeted indirect discrimination on wrongful grounds, such as gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation or religious belief; e) Abusive treatment of investors such as harassment, coercion, abuse of power, corrupt practices or similar bad faith conduct; or f) A breach of any further elements of the fair and equitable treatment obligation adopted by the Contracting Parties in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article. 
The Contracting Parties shall, upon request of a Contracting Party, review the content of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment and may complement this list through a joint interpretative declaration within the meaning of Article 31, paragraph 3, sub a, of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. 
When applying paragraph 2 of this Article, a Tribunal may take into account whether a Contracting Party made a specific representation to an investor to induce an investment that created a legitimate expectation, and upon which the investor relied in deciding to make or maintain that investment, but that the Contracting Party subsequently frustrated

For greater certainty, a breach of another provision of this Agreement or of any other international agreement does not constitute a breach of this Article. In addition, the fact that a measure breaches domestic law does not, in and of itself, establish a breach of this Article.
